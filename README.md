### Application

We will build the application shown as shown above.

The mock is located [here](https://github.com/rarguelloF/react-training/blob/master/design/index.html).

Algorithms discounts:
- When a main dish, a drink and a dessert are present in the shopping cart, they should be grouped and conform a **menu**. If there are multiple choices to create the menu, it has to be created with the cheaper products. *Menus have 20% discount*.
    - Products measured by units should conform **different** menus. If the product is measured by weight, it should stay within the same menu.
- From the remaining products, a **3x2** discount can be applied for products measured by **units**.
- The remaining products doesn't have any discount.
- The priority when applying discounts is: **menu > 3x2**. Discounts cannot be stacked.

### Development setup

- Mac or Linux
- `node v.7.4.0` or higher
- `npm v.4.0.5` or higher
